# Assert Hello World

Ever wanted to try TDD in a new language, but was afraid of the yaks that
had to be shavde to get to actually writing code? No more! This repo
contains the assert hello world skeleton in various languages and testing
tools, so you can get to coding fast!

# How does it work?

on ubuntu (or probably debian based systems)

    git clone https://github.com/zsoldosp/assert-hello-world.git
    cd assert-hello-world/<chose language>/<chosen testing lib>/
    ./setup.sh && ./test.sh
    $EDITOR


# History

This repo was inspired by my @zsoldosp's experience facilitating coderetreats,
where whole sessions could go by with the participants trying to get
the environment working. While the pairs surely have learned much, I would
like to offer people the chance to decide whether they want to learn
setting up the environment for a new language or want to learn the
language itself.
